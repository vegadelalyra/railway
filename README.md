The HTTP requests do have impact and you can POST, PATCH, PUT, DELETE and obviously GET.

## Where to check my server? 
https://railway-production-f503.up.railway.app/ <br>
On this link you will be able to see my json-server database displayed on database and ready to get accessed with an API interface.

## What about Railway? 
This PaaS which brinds you deployment and hosting services also allow you to deploy backend/full stack projects and not only static websites or SPAs. You also have access to your GItHub repositories, straightforward control over your server environment and performance and you can even attach any other data base server (postgresQL, for example).

Railway offers you a free limited tier. Beyond there, it stops being free.
